The recommended way of solving this in the Triarc framework is by using the <code>Async Request Message.vi</code> introduced in version 1.0.24.  The <code>Async Request Message.vi</code> takes, in addition to the regular Message string and Message Data variant, a <code>Callback</code> interface.

It is important to note that the asynchronous action is outside the process loop and cannot directly change the state of the process, but it may enqueue messages to the process which updates the state. Another caveat is that a change in state in the process will not be propagated to a running action. In order to propagate any state chnage to a running asynchronous action, it must be restarted from within the process loop.

The framework is built around modules, where each module is a library. Each module has a main.vi which, as the name suggests, is the main VI of the module. The main.vi contains two loops out of the box, where one handles events from the user interface or API calls, and the other loop is a message handling loop. The general idea is that events enter the module through the event loop of the main.vi and work is then enqueued to the message handling loop. A common design pattern is to implement helper loops in the main.vi which runs in parallel with the other loops. By heavily leveraging scripting, DQMH avoids the introduction of object orientation and greatly simplifies the creation of the events, which would otherwise be a quite tedious and error prone task. My personal favorite feature of DQMH is the Testers which comes with each module and facilitates manual testing of the module in isolation by making calls to the API.</p> <p>DQMH is freely available, although not open source.

There is not a single FGV, named queue, global variable, etc. in Triarc. If something needs to be globally accessible, which would often be the case with e.g. a log handler or error handler, the resource is injected on the top level VI, which is responsible for the lifecycle of the global resource. The lack of global state makes it very straight forward to instantiate multiple copies of the same Triarc Process.</p>"},{"location":"93_Triarc%20and%20DQMH/#dryness","title":"Dryness","text":"<p>In software engineering there is a principle of not repeating the logic when writing code (the Dry principle). While one has to be pragmatic and make decissions which fits the design, having duplicate logic means having duplicate bugs and duplicate code to maintain.</p> <p>In DQMH every module carries with it the full framework. One might argue that this is not an issue, as all the framework VIs are generated through scripting. In my opinion, the generated contet clutters the project and makes it difficult to get a quick overview of what the module API looks like. To illustrate this, let's have a look at the module for the device under test (DUT) in the thermal chamber template and compare it to the Triarc process implementing the same functionality.</p> <p></p> <p>Even if we were to lock the libraries to hide the private methods, there is still many times more stuff going on in the DQMH module. The reason we only need process specific VIs in the Triarc process is because all framework features are inherited from the main Triarc Process and View classes.</p> <p>One advantage of bundling the framework with each module created is that modules may use different versions of the framework and still work within the same application. The flipside is that each module must be updated when new versions of the framework is released. In Triarc breaking changes will need to be solved by namespacing the framework within versioned libraries with an incremental naming convention.</p>"},{"location":"93_Triarc%20and%20DQMH/#object-orientation","title":"Object Orientation","text":"<p>Whether object orientation is good or bad is beyond the scope of this post, but it does have a significant impact on the design. Triarc relies heavily on object oriented design, while DQMH only uses objects for certain subtasks.</p> <p>One clear drawback of using a library over a class in LabVIEW, is the fact tha libraries are not first class citizens in LabVIEW whilde classes are. This means that a class may be wired on the block diagram just as any other data type, while a library cannot be used in the same way. The implications of this is that libraries cannot be composed into larger composite structures. Triarc processes are classes and therefore composeable.</p> <p>By using object oriented design, powerful abstractions may be created and a lot of flexibility to define behavior at run-time is possible through subclassing. It also reduces the amount of code duplication as descending classes may use the parent class methods. A good example of this is the Show Panel.vi which is included in every DQMH module. In triarc this functionality is only defined in the View class and subclasses uses the VI from the View class to open therir panels.</p>"},{"location":"93_Triarc%20and%20DQMH/#dependency-inversion","title":"Dependency Inversion","text":"<p>One of the main benefits of object oriented design is the separation of source code dependencies from run time dependencies. As DQMH is not object oriented, it is not possible to use abstractions to invert dependencies without wrapping DQMH modules in classes. This is a major limitation of the framework and it misses out on one of the core ideas of object oriented design.</p>"},{"location":"93_Triarc%20and%20DQMH/#type-safety","title":"Type Safety","text":"<p>In DQMH each event has an associated data type defined by a typedefined cluster. The events are generated through scripting, so the tedious task of setting this up is handled by the framework. The outcome is that each event case has statically defined types which will give the correct types at edit time. This can be pretty useful to ensure bad type casts.</p> <p>In Triarc the data is flattened to a variant in each API VI and sent to the process as a variant. This puts the responsibility on the developer to cast the variant to the expected data type. In practice this is not too painful, as the pipeline the data goes through is well defined. It is more complicated for broadcasts, as each listener needs to know what data type to expect.</p> <p>The dynamic typing will require more testing and preferably automated testing to prevent regression issues. On the other hand, having the correct type is not equivalent with correct behavior and we should probably be doing the testing regardless.</p>"}]}
